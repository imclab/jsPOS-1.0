The Garden in October 
October is a fine time to plant every kind of "bulb, root and tuber," also all deciduous plants and shrubs, except those with thin bark or thick, fleshy roots (e.g., birch magnolia). 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Clean up and burn diseased plants, manure the garden, plow it and leave it all winter. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Burn asparagus tops and manure the bed. Also make new asparagus and rhubarb beds and plant sets of extra early pearl onions for use next March. Put some parsley plants in a box and place it in a light cellar or in a shed. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Put some frozen rhubarb roots in a barrel of earth in the cellar where they will produce "pie-plant," for winter use. Dig chickory for salad and store in sand in a dry cellar. Blanch endive by tying lightly at the tips. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Pull up cabbages, leaving roots on, and stand upside down on shelf in cellar. Pick cranberries this month. Then cover the bog with a foot of water to drown bugs and to protect from frost. Rake up the fallen leaves and use as a mulch for flowers and shrubs. Hardwood leaves like oak and chestnut contain more plant food than those from soft wooded trees.--_Garden and Farm Almanac. Doubleday, Page and Company._ 

Every Morning 
A Little Crystal of Thought for Every Day in the Week 

     SUNDAY. 
     Most of us could manage to be fairly happy if we really      tried to make the best of things. 

     MONDAY. 
     _Don't get depressed even if things do seem to be going      wrong at the moment. Depression will make matters worse      rather than better. If you do your duty faithfully, the sun      is sure to shine again sometime._ 

     TUESDAY. 
     Many people pride themselves on their plain speaking. An      ability to put things pleasantly is really far more      valuable. Even fault-finding can be pleasantly done. 

     WEDNESDAY. 
     _It always seems to me that God is probably less anxious      that we should fulfil our tasks in life than that we should      do our best._ 

     THURSDAY. 
     Of the people who complain most bitterly that they have "no      chance" probably a very small proportion would do great      things if great opportunities came. "No chance" is a very      old excuse. 

     FRIDAY. 
     _Don't give way to selfishness--that detestable vice that we      all find it so difficult to forgive in others._ 

     SATURDAY. 
     Even if you don't like your work, try to do it well. It may      lead on to your true vocation. 

For the Automobile Visitor 
It is the frequent experience of the housewife living in the country or suburbs these days to receive unexpected visits from friends who are touring in automobiles, and she finds she must have something attractive, dainty and nourishing ready at a moment's notice to supplement the cup of tea or coffee so welcome after a hot, dusty trip. It is a wise plan to keep a variety of Summer Sausage on hand, as in a very few minutes delicious sandwiches may be prepared with this, these sandwiches having the charm of novelty. It is impossible to deal in a short article with the many varieties of Summer Sausage, but there are three or four which can be touched upon. To have a thorough understanding of their goodness one must not only read about them but taste them. They are the staple diet in many foreign countries and in the Armour brand the native flavoring has been done with remarkable faithfulness--so much so that large quantities are shipped from this country every week to the countries where they originated. 
CERVELAT: This sausage is made of finest pork chopped fine, smoked and air dried. It is highly spiced. A very delicious way to serve this is to cut thin slices of white bread in rounds just the size of the sausage. Put the meat, cut very thin, between the slices of bread and toast for a minute with a very hot fire. This keeps the exposed sides absolutely dry and the sandwich can be eaten without a fork. 
GERMAN SALAMI: This sausage will be much appreciated by people who like the smoky flavor of ham and bacon. In it the meat is chopped a little coarser than in the Cervelat, and the spicing is the same as that used in Germany. Serve cut very thin, with rye or bran bread. 
LACKSCHINKEN: This is a very delicately flavored German titbit. It is made of boneless pork loins cured in mild sweet pickle before smoking. It makes delicious sandwiches with white or brown bread sliced thin and lightly buttered. 
MORTADELLA, a favorite Italian sausage, is made from lean pork ham meat chopped very fine. The flavoring is delicious, the careful blending of spices giving a distinctly foreign touch. 
In many restaurants throughout the country they serve, as in foreign countries, a slice or two of Summer Sausage as an appetizer before beginning the meal. This custom is rapidly spreading into the home, and Summer Sausage now has an established place in the daily bill of fare.

Editorial 

[Illustration] 
In Germany the government maintains a system of education in what is called intensive farming. Through instructors who go about the country, the farmers are taught how to get a bigger yield from the same area of soil. The work of these wonderful teachers is supplemented by women domestic science teachers who in the same manner visit the homes in their districts and instruct the good _Haus Frau_ on how to improve, economize, and systematize in kitchen and household work. 
The manner in which these women instruct is, I am sure, of especial interest to the Cook Book readers, inasmuch as the method is in a way practically the same as what the Cook Book is doing. Where they teach by hand and mouth the Cook Book has taught through its exchange of ideas, contest stories, and recipe contests, the object being the same in both cases that of instruction, education and economy in the kitchen and saving of steps in the housework. 
It is truly said of Germans that they are the most frugal and economical of all people. In the past the usual method has been to exert this frugality with what is already on hand in the larder left-overs, so to speak. One point of the modern instruction of these wandering domestic science teachers, as they go from home to home, is to show the economy of systematic buying of groceries, meats and vegetables. Where the practice in the past has been to buy a little, so there is not much expenditure of money, German housewives are now taught the economy of buying in bulk, because it is cheaper, and there is never any waste of food in a German home, no matter how much of it there may be on hand. 
Neither is there any good reason why there should be any waste of food in an American home. Economy or frugality comes from knowing how, and not from any stingy purpose, as some ill-advised people think. 
The methods of these teachers show that this wonderful nation is alive to the fact that the high cost of living is in our own waste and carelessness, that oftentimes we do not make the most of what we have or what we are given to do with.

The Sweet Places 
    _I want to go back to the sweet mysterious places,       The crook in the creek-bed nobody knew but me,     Where the roots in the bank thrust out strange knotty faces,       Scaring the squirrels who stole there timidly._ 
    _I want to lie under the corn and hear it rustle,       Cool and green in a long, straight, soldierly row,     I am tired of white-faced women and men of iron.       I want to go back where the country grasses grow._ 
    _To the well-remembered pasture's shadiest corner,       Where under the trees the wild ferns wove their laces;     Hearing the whip-poor-will's voice in its strange, rich sadness--       I want to go back to the old beloved places._ 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Unafraid 
    Sleep lifts the flower-soul with gentle hand,       And breathes upon it till the petals close       Softly and drowsily; and, faint, there grows     A melody from some far shining strand.     The waking vision's holden to, till, fanned       By vagrant winds from distant ports, it blows       The singing lips of dreams into the rose.     The white Night leans to kiss the nodding land.     Thus, in a kindred way, will Brother Death     At the appointed hour let fall his breath     Upon my soul, which such kind dreamlessness     Of pillowing, after Life's storm and stress.     I shall lie unafraid, my petals furled,     To bloom anew within some fairer world.

To Bleach White Silk 
When either white silk fabric or embroidery has become yellowed from careless washing, it may be bleached in the following manner: 
Dissolve two ounces each of salt and oxalic acid in six quarts of cold water. 
Soak the silk in this until the yellow tinge disappears. This will take about an hour in ordinary cases. 
Rinse immediately in several clear waters. 



The Subject of Desserts 

[Illustration] 
Although a meal satisfies your hunger you should have dessert, because the educated palate craves that particular spice as a proper finish. Scientists tell us that a dinner digests better because of a tasty dessert, which, they say, gives the final stimulus necessary to dispose of the food previously received. 
The simple desserts are the best desserts, and none is more pleasing to the eye and the palate or so easily made or so frequently served in an imperfect manner, than custards. 
With a supply of good eggs in the pantry the housewife need never be at a loss for a tasty custard, and if she is wise enough to buy Armour's Fancy Selects when she orders eggs from her market man their goodness will be reflected in her desserts. Aside from their goodness their extra large size will always recommend their use to the wise housewife. They come packed in an extra large carton. 

Custard Puddings 
These being the more easily made may be considered first. They may either be steamed or baked but the mixture is the same in either case. Allow two eggs and a teaspoonful of sugar to each half pint of milk. Beat the eggs with sugar thoroughly, but do not froth them, as the custard must be as smooth and free from holes as possible. Add the milk slowly, also a few drops of flavoring essence--vanilla, almonds or lemon. Pour into a buttered mould (or into individual moulds), set in a pan of hot water and bake until firm. Chill thoroughly and turn out on serving dish. Serve with sugar and cream. A pleasing addition to the above is made by garnishing the sides of the mould with strips of Canton ginger before pouring in the custard. 

Coffee Custard 
Make an infusion of coffee by pouring half a pint of boiling milk on a heaping tablespoonful of powdered coffee. Put it aside to settle, and when cold strain off the milk and use with the eggs as in previous recipe. 
Boiled Custard 
This is also made from milk and eggs and is usually served instead of cream with stewed or preserved fruit. "Boiled" custard is rather a misnomer as on no account must the boiling point be reached in cooking, for if the custard bubbles it curdles. As soon as the custard begins to thicken the saucepan must be taken from the fire and the stirring continued for a second or two longer. If the cooking is done in a double boiler the risk of boiling is very much lessened. 



Everyday Uses of Armour's Grape Juice 
Give your family Armour's Grape Juice as an everyday beverage and their bodies will be kept healthy without drugs. 
Instead of serving fruit in the morning serve a wineglassful of Armour's Grape Juice undiluted. If taken at the beginning of breakfast do not add ice. For children, water may be added if desired. 
In moistening mincemeat use Armour's Grape Juice instead of jelly or wine. In making "Brown Betty" use Armour's Grape Juice instead of water and molasses and you will find it richer and more delicious. 
In making sauce for all kinds of fruit puddings, use Armour's Grape Juice, hot or cold, thickened when necessary with a little cornstarch. 
When making fruit salad to be served as a dessert, pour over the mixed fruits, immediately before serving, a cup of Armour's Grape Juice. 
In serving grape fruit, after carefully removing the white pith, pour over each portion a wineglassful of Armour's Grape Juice. 
Many people find it difficult to take raw eggs when recommended by their doctor. This difficulty is removed by breaking the egg into a glass of Armour's Grape Juice. The egg is swallowed easily and in addition to the nourishment obtained there is the tonic value of the rich fruit from which the grape juice is taken. 
_VERIBEST CANNED MEATS--save work and worry_ 



Informal Porch Suppers 
[Illustration] 

If you are fortunate enough to possess a wide porch or a stretch of lawn do not forget your less fortunate friends, and give an occasional informal party there while the weather is still fine. Food always tastes so much better in the fresh air and when friends are present it makes the affair nothing more than a kind of glorified picnic. There are few more pleasant ways of entertaining than by giving a porch party. It is very little trouble to arrange an affair of this kind--less than the average picnic indeed--and grown people usually enjoy it more as it is much more comfortable to sit in a chair before a real table than to perch on a log or rock while eating. A porch party is an ideal way of entertaining for the woman who has to do her own work. Most of the dishes can be prepared the day before, making the serving easier. 
If not convenient to have a large table a number of small card tables placed close together will answer the purpose. Charming table sets of white crepe paper can be bought for very little and save very materially in the doing up of the linen. 
Prepare as much as possible early in the day. If you have sandwiches wrap them in a damp napkin; if cold drinks are wanted have them well chilled, your glasses and straws handy, have your silver and china ready at hand so that when your guests arrive you may devote your time and attention to them. The following menus are not hard to prepare and the dishes will be found most palatable and suited to every purse: Veribest Canned Meats, the standby of the housewife who combines economy of time with excellence of quality, are used in many of them. There is a wide range of these meats delicious and many ways of using them. Every pantry should have at least one shelf devoted to them so that the housewife need never be at a loss for the basis of a good meal. 
    FRUIT COCKTAIL 
    HAM MOUSSE, POTATO CHIPS     or     CREAMED CHICKEN, served in roll,     or     TONGUE TOAST, CREAM SAUCE     or     CHICKEN IN ASPIC IN INDIVIDUAL MOULDS 
    POTATOES AU GRATIN 
    TOMATO WAFFLES 
    SALAD ROLLS 
    CHILLED CUCUMBERS 
    MARSHMALLOW PUDDING     or     FIG CUSTARD 
    COFFEE FRAPPE ICED COCOA     GRAPE JUICE. 

Ham Mousse 
One tablespoonful granulated gelatine, one half cup hot water, one can Veribest Deviled Ham, teaspoonful mustard (mixed), one half cup rich cream. 
Dissolve the gelatine in the hot water, and add to the ham; season with the mustard, add the cream beaten stiff and pour into a mould which has been previously wet with cold water. Chill. Turn out to serve and garnish with parsley. 

Creamed Chicken 
Make a plain white sauce of one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful flour and one cup of milk with seasoning of salt and pepper. When this is ready add the contents of a can of Veribest Boned Chicken, gently pulling apart the flakes of meat with a fork. When thoroughly heated serve in a roll which has been hollowed out for the purpose, with a garnish of cooked asparagus stalks. 

Tongue Toast 
Remove the contents of a can of Veribest Lunch Tongue and cut in dice. Add a little cream and the beaten yolk of one egg. Simmer for a few minutes and serve on squares of toast. 

Potatoes au Gratin 
Dice enough cold boiled potatoes to measure one pint. Put one tablespoonful of butter and the same amount of flour in a saucepan with a little salt and pepper. Cook till well mixed, then add one cupful of milk and stir until smooth and thick. Add the potatoes and simmer five minutes, then pour into a buttered, shallow baking dish. Mix one scant cupful of fine, dry bread crumbs with one tablespoonful of melted butter, spread over the potatoes and place in a hot oven until the crumbs are a golden brown, then serve hot. 

Marshmallow Pudding 
Make a plain lemon jelly, adding a little sherry wine if desired. Put a layer of sliced marshmallows in the bottom of the mold, and when the jelly has begun to set spread a little of it over them. Continue with jelly and marshmallows till the mold is full, then put away to harden. Serve with whipped cream. 

A Dainty Dessert 
Lemon and grape juice frappe is another cool dessert that is also light. To make it, boil a pint of water with two cupfuls of granulated sugar for ten minutes and cool it. Then add a little cinnamon and half a cupful of lemon juice, and lastly a quart of Armour's grape juice. Freeze and serve in cups, with a little of the grape juice.

Shelving Responsibility 
"I'll ask my husband." 
"I don't think my husband would allow me to do that." 
"I'm sure Jack would say 'No.'" 
Do you know the wife who, whenever she does not want to do anything, always places the responsibility on her husband's shoulders? 
She knows quite well that she can do almost anything she likes with her husband, and that there are really precious few things that he _would_ say "No" to her doing, but she finds that to say her husband would never allow her to do this, or that, is a very easy way of saying "No" to people without offending them. 
But it's not quite fair on the husband really, because, after a time, people begin to think that he really must be rather a bear to be so strict with his wife. 
And he gets disliked, very often, accordingly. 
If you don't want to do a thing, _say_ so; don't make your husband the scapegoat. 
Of course the wife who does this kind of thing never dreams that people will blame her husband: it's just a convenient fiction to her. 
But people are apt to think less of her husband because of it. 
So you'll be wise to find some other excuse when excuses are necessary.--_Exchange._ 



A Necessity in the Pantry 

"How can you get along without a ham in the house?" asked one housewife of another; "to me it is as necessary as anything we ever have in our pantry." 
This housewife, in saying the above, echoed the sentiments of many others. There is no meat more "necessary" in the house than good ham. Not only is the meat there in all its nutriment but it is preserved--that is, cured and smoked--in such a way that there is given to it a piquancy which whets the appetite and gives a stimulus to the gastric juices, thus aiding--so the doctors tell us--the process of digestion. 
In so many cases of convalescence where the appetite is flagging and the digestion weak, ham and bacon are prescribed, both for their tonic and nutritive value. 
On the crisp snappy mornings of autumn when a hearty breakfast is necessary and the appetite has not yet recovered from the jading effects of the hot weather what could be more tempting and more nourishing than a slice of broiled ham--broiled just enough to be thoroughly cooked and yet not enough to discolor the delicious appetising pink color of the meat. Even the aroma thrown out in the process of cooking sends a tempting appeal to the stomach that is impossible to resist. 
Buying a whole ham at a time is the best and most economical way of buying ham, as experience will prove. It can be boiled or baked whole and sliced for whatever purpose intended. When baked ham is broiled for breakfast it requires to be cooked just long enough to get hot all the way through. 
It is many years since the curing of ham was first tried and in those years much has been accomplished. Today Armour's Star Hams represent perfection in cured ham. In them the highest quality is allied to skillful curing and careful smoking. 
From many thousand hams those intended for the Star brand are chosen; the process of curing is a specialty of Armour and Company, and careful smoking over green hickory logs gives the final necessary touch. 
They say "the proof of the pudding is the tasting of it" and this applies to Armour's Star Hams as well. 
[Many ways of using this, to most people, necessary meat, will be found on page 12.]

Halloween Hints 

Witch Apples 
Bake large apples from which the core has been removed until soft, but not long enough to burst the skin. When cooked, insert a marshmallow into the core space, put a teaspoonful of sugar on top and a few maraschino cherries. When ready to serve turn over each a scant teaspoonful of brandy and light just as the table is reached. The brandy will burn with a ghastly flame and melt the sugar and marshmallows. Whipped cream served in a bowl is a delicious addition. 

Witch Cake 
Cream one half cupful of butter with one and one half cupfuls of sugar; add three eggs and beat five minutes; add one cupful of milk. Sift together one third cupful of cornstarch, and two cupfuls of flour, one and one half teaspoonfuls of ground mixed spices, and three teaspoonfuls of baking powder; then add to the mixture. Now add one cupful of seeded floured raisins, also one cupful of chopped nuts. Turn into a well greased loaf cake pan and bake in a moderate oven about forty-five minutes. Frost with a white boiled icing. Melt sweet chocolate to equal one third cupful, flavor with a teaspoonful of lemon juice, add one cupful of boiled chestnuts which have been run through the meat grinder, and enough confectionery sugar to make a paste easily handled. Roll and cut (by pasteboard pattern) black cats or any other Halloween figure, press them into the icing on the sides of the cake. 



Sauteing and Frying 
[Illustration] 

"What is the difference between sauteing potatoes and frying them?" asks a young housekeeper from South Dakota in the Day's Work, and as the subject is of much importance and deserving of more space than may be given to it in the correspondence columns it is answered here. 
In a word, to saute--pronounced sotay--anything, is to cook it in a shallow frying pan with a little fat, turning as one side is browned to let the other color. Cooked potatoes are often warmed over this way. To "fry" potatoes, croquettes, etc., is to cook them in deep boiling fat, immersing the object to be fried while the fat is boiling hot. 
That is the difference between sauteing and frying but there are one or two points about frying--this much abused way of cooking--that must be borne in mind if one would have the best results. In frying, a deep kettle must be used and it is wise to keep one for this purpose only. The one called a Scotch bowl is especially made for this purpose and is most satisfactory. 
Use only the best fat for frying--an absolutely pure leaf lard which contains neither water nor salt and have your kettle two thirds full, that is, deep enough to quite cover the article to be fried. Once started, this quantity must be kept up, as it reduces slightly with each frying, but the same fat may be used again and again if care be taken to keep it clean and of a good color. After each frying let the fat cool a little and strain to remove crumbs, etc., which would otherwise burn and spoil the fat. If strained when very hot it is apt to unsolder the strainer. Wipe the kettle clean, return the strained lard and set aside until wanted again. 
French Fried Potatoes are sliced thin or cut lengthwise in strips laid in ice water for half an hour; then dried thoroughly between two towels and plunged into boiling deep fat. As soon as they are delicately browned they are fished out with a split spoon and laid in a hot colander to drain off every drop of fat. Serve at once. 
German Fried Potatoes are as a rule cooked and cold before they are sauteed. Some prefer them to the French. To many minds they never get quite rid of the stale taste that clings to the cold potato. The same may be said of stewed cold, cooked potatoes. The least objectionable way of serving them as left-overs is to saute them. 
[Illustration: Simple Furniture of Quaint Shape and Design] 
"_To have bread excite thankfulness, and a drink of water send the heart to God, is better than sighs for the unattainable. To plough a straight furrow on Monday, or dust a room well on Tuesday, or kiss a bumped forehead on Wednesday, is worth more than the most ecstatic thrill under Sunday eloquence. Spirituality is seeing God in common things and showing God in common tasks._"--MALTBIE D. BACOCK. 



The School Child's Sleep 

The mother who has a child at school may not be able to help him with his lessons, but there is one thing she can do for him which will benefit him even more, and that is to see that he gets enough sleep. 
Insufficient sleep affects the nerves, the temper, the digestion, the mental quickness, and even the morals of children. The child who gets enough sleep is the one who is bright and quick mentally, who grows normally and well, who eats properly and who is not peevish and irritable. 
An early supper and an early bedtime are the things for the school child. Then put him in a well-ventilated bedroom and let him have ten or eleven full hours of slumber and he'll wake up bright and healthy and good, too. 
Many of the little whining nervous children we see are simply suffering from lack of sleep. Many small naughtinesses simply come from tired nerves and weariness of mind and body. So many mothers notice such a difference in the behavior of children once they have started to school and are at a loss to understand the reason. It is because the daily nap which the child took before he went to school has been given up, but the bedtime hour has not been changed. Consequently the nerves of the child suffer. 
Try giving the school child supper at half past five, a nourishing and easily digested supper, too. Then at eight, promptly pack him off to bed. If he doesn't sleep let him sip a cup of hot milk, and sit beside him until he drowses off. Sleep is largely a habit and will be easily acquired in a few evenings. And oh, the difference it will make to the child in every way.--_Exchange._

Hints on Picture Hanging 
Hang the pictures from the ceiling or picture rail by means of a thin cord as nearly as possible the color of the walls. When this is done you may, if you like, fill up the spaces left above the smaller pictures by placing therein a miniature, or an old blue plate, or a little plaster relief. This arrangement gives all the space, above or below, upon which to rest your eyes, and is infinitely preferable to the usual way of hanging pictures one over the other or all up and down the walls. Fishing line makes an excellent substitute for picture wire and is much less conspicuous. 



From the Pantry Shelf 
     Keeping the pantry shelf supplied with foods that are easily      prepared and served is one of the things which mark the      careful housewife. The Veribest list of prepared foods      embraces soups, meats, baked beans and many varieties of      potted ham, veal, chicken, etc., all of which are perfect.      Their use means a saving of time, fuel and energy--with      satisfaction for the whole family. 

CHICKEN MOUSSE 
One cup of chicken stock (made from Armour's Chicken Bouillon Cubes), one half teaspoon of salt, a pinch of celery salt, one cup of Armour's Veribest Boned Chicken, two teaspoons of granulated gelatine, two tablespoons of cold water, one cup of beaten cream, one tablespoon of chopped olives, and whites of two eggs. Heat the stock, seasoning and gelatine which has been soaked in cold water. When dissolved, add the chicken finely minced with fork, and the cream. Beat well and fold in the well-beaten whites of eggs. Pour into buttered molds and chill for two or three hours. Serve as salad with mayonnaise.--MRS. A. E. RICHESON, 830 CANAL ST., MT. VERNON, IND.

Saving Steps in the Kitchen 

The kitchen should be characterized by cleanliness, system and order. Two maxims that will help save steps are: "A place for everything, and everything in its place;" and "Plan your work, then work your plan." 
1. Arrange kitchen as conveniently and systematically as possible. Walls and floors should be easily cleaned. No superfluous furnishings or worn-out utensils should be tolerated. Arrange stove, sink, shelves, table or kitchen cabinet near together and in logical order, so that in preparing a dish one can move from raw material at table or cabinet around to the washed dish at sink. Have shelves and hooks within easy reach. Have drain-board and shelves for dishes convenient to sink. Keep stove lifters and cloths for managing hot dishes upon hooks near stove. Arrange those utensils and raw materials in constant use close at hand, placing utensils used in same kind of work together. In storeroom and pantry arrange shelves in certain order, with things seldom used on highest shelves and those used oftener on lower shelves. Place together ingredients used for salad-making, as vinegar, mustard, etc.; things used in laundry together, etc. Other groups will suggest themselves. Keep all groceries possible in air-tight labelled cans or glass jars. 
2. Stock your kitchen with as many labor-saving devices as you can afford, making sure they are suited to your needs. Keep all utensils and tools in good repair. Glass oven-doors, small tables upon rollers which can be wheeled into dining room, indexed cook books and clipping-files are step-savers. 
3. Plan each day's work ahead and have materials and utensils for that day's work handy. 
4. Do all kitchen work in a certain order, using that routine which experience has proved best. 
5. Think before you step. When in storeroom or pantry bring as many needed articles as possible at one time. Baskets and waiters are great helps here. In preparing a certain dish first gather together all necessary ingredients and utensils. Do not begin work until everything is ready. When possible prepare several things for the stove at once. 
6. Clean and straighten as you go, replacing disarranged utensils, etc. Have plenty of hot water handy, placing in soak those articles which cannot be washed immediately. While preparing one meal do as much as possible toward getting the next ready. If meals are planned ahead, many things for supper can be cooked with the noon-day meal, also the breakfast cereal. After each meal leave everything ship-shape for the next. 
     MRS. L. H. MCRAVEN, MERIDIAN, MISS.

       *       *       *       *       * 
_Keep a small market basket handy. In it place the things to be taken upstairs when you are going up and when you are making the beds and dusting, the things which are to be brought down._ 
       *       *       *       *       *

_Keep a chair or revolving stool in the kitchen and whenever possible sit down to work. Vegetable paring, cake beating and even washing and ironing may be done sitting._ 
       *       *       *       *       * 
_Have a method in your work. Occasionally take time to sit down and think over the day's work, and remember how many unnecessary steps you took yesterday._ 
       *       *       *       *       * 
_Have your kitchen shelves arranged to suit your own height, so that there is no unnecessary straining to reach up or bending over to reach one set too low._ 



Supplying the Meat Flavor 
     There are many meat dishes very nourishing and wholesome      which are total failures because of their lack of flavor.      This lack of flavor seriously impairs their value in      nutriment. A little Armour's Extract of Beef will in every      case provide that touch of flavor which appeals to the      palate and finds ready response from the digestive juices of      the stomach. This extract is very highly concentrated, so      that only a little is required. 

RICE SOUP 
Dissolve one teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef in one quart of water, add one half cup of cooked rice, and a tablespoon of onion juice. Add one teaspoon of celery seed and cover closely. Simmer ten minutes and just before serving add one fourth cup of sweet cream or a tablespoon of butter. If too thick, add a little boiling water or milk.---MRS. W. V. COPELAND, 227 N. LAKE STREET, TOPEKA, KANS. 

SPINACH AND SAUCE 
After spinach has boiled for twenty minutes in salt water, drain it and serve with this sauce: Dissolve one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef in a cup of hot water, add two tablespoons of butter, break in two eggs and use half teaspoon of lemon juice. Stir constantly and cook for a few minutes.--MRS. W. I. COLE, PUNTA GORDA, FLA. 

TOMATO ASPIC JELLY 
One fourth teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef, one can of Veribest Tomato Soup, one half package of gelatine, three hard-boiled eggs, and chopped olives. Heat the soup with an equal amount of water. Soak the gelatine in half cup of cold water and dissolve in the soup. Add Extract of Beef dissolved in a little water. Let cool. Add chopped hard boiled eggs and olives. If there is cold chicken at hand, a half cup of chicken chopped will improve the jelly. Pour into mold and put on ice. Serve with mayonnaise on lettuce leaves.--MRS. R. M. BRUMBY, ANONA, FLA. 

STUFFED TOMATOES 
Remove seeds and centers from six tomatoes. Chop three green peppers and one onion and fry in butter until the onions begin to brown. Add a small lump of butter, some chopped nuts and dried bread crumbs, salt and pepper to season, and one third cup of hot water in which one half teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef has been dissolved. Put the tomatoes in baking pan and fill with this mixture. Sprinkle crumbs over tops and bake fifteen minutes.--MRS. L. C. STUMP, 444 N. DENVER AVE., KANSAS CITY, MO.

Rinse the peas, add some water and boil until soft, then rub through a colander. Add Armour's Extract of Beef to hot water and peas, making one quart in all. Melt the butter and add the flour, then gradually the hot soup. Cook until smooth, add the seasoning, and the milk and cream last.--KATHERINE SORLIE, BUXTON, N. DAK. 

CORN SOUP 
Cook in two tablespoons of butter one onion and one sprig of parsley (cut fine) for five minutes.

Home Dressmaking 
[Illustration] 

This is an age of good ready made clothes and it is also an age of clever amateur dressmaking. With excellent patterns which may be easily handled there is no reason why the woman who can sew should not make her own clothes, and have smart clothes at a reasonable price--that is, provided she has the time to give to sewing. 
Before starting a dress--even before buying--make a tour of the shops and see for yourself what is being worn with a keen eye for the little details which lift a gown from the home made to the professional class. If you live far from town and can not go to the shops look through the magazines which make a feature of dress and study what is best suited to your particular style and requirements. Study materials and buy economically, which means paying a little more if necessary rather than have shoddy goods. 
Good patterns are essential and these usually have full directions as to the manner of using. It is a very good plan to have a pattern drafted to your own measure but if you have not this take some finished garment which is satisfactory (unless there is someone at hand to take the measures that a person cannot very well take for herself) and measure the lengths in different places such as front, back and under lengths on a blouse and the width across both back and front where it is broadest. Write these down and proceed to take the same measures on the pattern to be used. In taking measures be sure to take a correct position or it will be impossible to get correct measures and you cannot hope for success if this--the initial step--is taken wrongly. For instance, stand erect with the chest raised and the abdomen held in and you will find in taking the width measures across to where the arms and body join the armhole will be straight and even looking instead of pointing in and out in places. 
Make sure of your measures before starting to apply your pattern to the cloth. A careful study of this will save many irreparable mistakes later. 



Halloween 

The date of this oldtime celebration is always October 31st, the crucial moment 12 o'clock. To be sure, the original observance of All Hallows Eve has been considerably distorted during the course of years but the fun it affords the young folks in its present manner of keeping cannot be gainsaid and needs no changing. Halloween is the night when a magic spell enthrals the earth. Witches, bogies, brownies and elves are all abroad to use their power. Superstition proves true, witchery is recognized and the future may be read in a hundred and one ways. 
No occasion gives more opportunity of enjoyment and no party is gayer than a Halloween party. 
It is not necessary to spend a great deal of money in giving a Halloween party. With a little time, some suitable paper and a pair of sharp scissors the witches, pumpkin faces, cats and bats, which are the distinctive features of this decoration, may be easily made at home. Yellow, red and black are the colors and the most fascinating crepe paper can be had for a few cents. This is the best material to use, as it lends itself so well to all sorts of schemes. 
Not only is it made in plain colors which may be decorated at will but for every festival and occasion there are special designs which make the work of decoration very easy indeed. 
For Halloween there is a design of witches with brooms, or cats and bats in black on a yellow ground. This is ready to be laid on the table as a cover or around the room in the effect of a frieze. There are napkins to match and a crepe paper rope to finish the edge. 
A weird effect of lighting is obtained by making lantern boxes from any discarded boxes which may be in the house. Cover them with crepe paper, cut eyes, nose, ears and mouth, paste colored tissue paper behind the features and set a lighted candle inside. 
The wise owl must not be forgotten in the Halloween decorations. Grey paper is best for him. Paste the edges of a square piece of grey crepe paper together lengthwise of the grain and gather in at the bottom. Stuff this bag with soft paper or cotton and gather again some distance from the top. Shape the top into ears and make two rosettes with black centers for eyes. A beak of black stiff paper protrudes between the eyes. Mount the owl on a branch by sewing with heavy black thread in a way to resemble claws. 
Make witches' brooms by tying slashed paper tied on any old sticks or brooms to give the effect.

How to Clean It 

Brass Ornaments 
Any brass which is exposed to the air is likely to tarnish very quickly. To obviate this, after I have cleaned and polished my brass vases etc., in the usual way I take a rag, and with this smear just a tiny scrap of vaseline over the brass. This keeps it bright and prevents it from tarnishing. 

Wicker Tables or Chairs 
To take stains out of white wicker-work, I get some oxalic acid, and with an old toothbrush dipped in this I brush the stained parts well. Then I rinse the article thoroughly, first in clear, warm water, and then in cold. The brush should be destroyed after use, as oxalic acid is poisonous. 

To Wash Chiffon 
To wash chiffon, wind the material round a bottle. Make a good lather of soap and water. Immerse the bottle, and move backwards and forwards in the lather for about five minutes. Rinse in clear, lukewarm water in which has been dissolved a small piece of gum arabic. Then unwind the chiffon, spread on the ironing board, lay a clean, thin cloth over it, and iron with a very hot iron. 

A Black Hat 
The very best way to clean a black hat, whether it be chip, mohair, or tagel, real or imitation, is to make some rather strong tea, and, after brushing all dust from the hat, apply this with a small brush. Saturate the hat thoroughly, and when dry it will be as perfect in colour and appearance as when first bought. 
If you want the hat to be stiff, add half a teaspoonful of liquid gum to the tea, and mix well before applying. The hat will then keep its stiffness, but will not have a glossy appearance. 

Real Lace 
Real lace should never be washed, but can be cleaned in the following way. Put it between layers of tissue paper well sprinkled with calcined magnesia, place between the leaves of a book, and under a heavy weight for three days. Then shake the powder out and the lace will be perfectly clean. 



Small Pieces from the Whole Ham 
     The economy of buying a whole ham at once instead of a pound      or a slice is apparent to every housewife who studies her      weekly bills. The initial cost is less--many trips to the      store are saved and the housewife has the chance of using      all of the ham--trimmings, skin, bone, etc., etc. 

HAM TOAST 
Grind or chop enough Armour's Star Ham to make a cupful, using a little of the fat. Melt one tablespoon of butter in a sauce pan and add one tablespoon of flour. As soon as blended add one and one third cups of milk. When slightly thickened add the ham and the whites of two hard-boiled eggs which have been mashed with fork. Season with salt, pepper, and pour over round slices of toast which have been placed on hot platter. Grate the yolks of eggs and sprinkle over the top. Garnish with parsley.--MRS. G. F. JONES, 79 WASHINGTON ST., PORTLAND, MAINE. 

HAM DUMPLINGS 
Cut from a boiled Star Ham fat and lean in equal proportions and chop fine. Season with pepper and minced sage. Make a crust of one half pound of Armour's Butterine and one pound of flour. Roll it out thick and divide it into equal portions. Put some ham into each and close up the crust. Have ready a pot of boiling water and put in the dumplings. Boil about forty-five minutes.--MISS M. C. GREEN, 319 LOCUST ST., HUNTSVILLE, ALA.

Rub the yolks smooth with a little of the cream and add to the cream in the farina boiler with the ham. Press the whites of the two eggs through a sieve, add to the mixture and when thoroughly heated put on a hot dish. Slice the remaining eggs over the ham and serve.--MRS. R. SCHROEDER, 1923 AVENUE D, BIRMINGHAM, ALA. 

ESCALLOPED HAM

Cut a cup of Armour's Star Ham (cold boiled) into dice and moisten half a cup of cracker crumbs in melted butter. Chop the whites of the eggs fine, sprinkle some crumbs in a buttered dish, then some of the ham, the chopped whites, thickened milk and sifted yolks. Then add the remainder of the ham, whites of eggs and milk, cover with buttered crumbs and bake until brown.---ALMA E. EDDY, COLLEGE CITY, CAL.

Little Stories by Our Readers 

A Ham Story 
[Illustration] 
As we are lovers of good ham we always use Armour's Star Brand. I generally buy the ham on Saturday as it keeps better than fresh meat. I buy a whole ham (try to get one about ten pounds), then get the dealer to cut two nice slices thick enough to broil, a little beyond the center, leaving two nice ends, the string end the smaller. One slice I use for Sunday morning Breakfast, the other one I wrap in a moist cloth, place between two plates. This will keep three or four days. 
I now take the large end, put it on in cold water, let simmer for a couple of hours, then take out and drain; cut off skin, and part of the fat and put it in the oven to finish cooking. The skin I save for use on the griddle, the fat I render and use the dripping for salads. After baking, serve hot or cold, sliced; I still have a small end and one slice left, the small end I boil until thoroughly done, take out and use the water for vegetables, such as cabbage, spinach, beans, etc. The small end does not slice as well as the other so I take all the meat from the bone, and put it through the chopper, grind it fine, and use it for ham loaf, toast filling for tomato cups or for ham omelet. The baked end I serve sliced, also, use for sandwiches. If I have to keep the sandwiches I put them in a moistened napkin; it keeps the ham moist and juicy. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
How I Arrange to Use a Whole Ham 
SUNDAY BREAKFAST: Water cress, slice Star Ham broiled with milk gravy, hot rolls, coffee, home-made peach cake. 
SUNDAY DINNER: Beef pot roast, white potatoes whipped, sweet potatoes roasted under the meat, cauliflower boiled in the ham water, cream dressing, fruit sherbet, in which I use Armour's Grape Juice. 
SUNDAY SUPPER: Cold baked Star Ham sliced thin, or tomato cups on lettuce with mustard dressing, white bread and butter, home-made cake, sliced peaches, and tea. 
To make TOMATO CUPS, take medium size tomatoes, skin them (by pouring boiling water over them first, this is easily done) and put on ice until cold; scoop out the center. Make a filling of minced ham, a little chicken, breadcrumbs (equal parts), a seasoning of chopped peppers; fill tomatoes; on top of each put a little mustard dressing. Set each cup on a lettuce leaf, and serve. 
Now I still have one slice of ham left, some minced ham, some of the baked ham. The last slice I broil and serve with poached eggs; the baked ham, makes sandwiches. The week I buy a whole ham I don't buy much other meat. Trusting this will be of value to some, I remain,--I. M. B., Philadelphia.

Milk Toast 
"Have kept Armour's Beef Extract always on hand for years and it has helped me out of many a tight place. One day the children teased for milk toast for supper, and to my dismay I found the milk was 'short' that day. Not wishing to disappoint them I tried to see what I could do. I made a consomme with Armour's Beef Extract, using a quarter teaspoonful to a cup and seasoning it with salt and pepper, and used this in the same way as I would milk. Our 'milk' toast was fit for a king. The children pronounced it the best ever. In these times of high prices, with milk at ten cents per quart, many a family would welcome such an excellent substitute as Armour's Extract." 
Most useful are the Armour's Bouillon Cubes. I use them in preparing soups, gravies, dissolved and poured over a roast while cooking. I give my husband and children each one in a cup of hot water, every morning for breakfast, the first thing, as it seems to be an appetizer; also serve it to my aged parents in the morning before rising, as it gives them strength to make their toilet. They are both very aged and failing and the effect of the bouillon is wonderful. My husband also takes Armour's Bouillon Cubes with him in his lunch basket to the factory where he holds a clerical position; he keeps his bouillon cup and spoon and there is plenty of boiling water accessible, so it makes a nice, nourishing drink at lunch time.--Mrs. E. B., Greensburg, Pa.

A Red Letter for Armour's Extract 
We have a friend who derived more benefit (in our estimation) from Armour's Extract, than any one we have ever heard of. He is an expert machinist and is sent to all parts of the world to put up machines, such as reapers, mowers, etc. The particular trip I write of he was sent to Bulgaria, to a small village, where the accommodations were very poor. Sleep was almost out of the question and to eat the black bread, which was the principal food, was impossible. The water in all foreign countries was so bad that he always carried jars of the Extract with him. This time he not only dissolved it in hot water and drank it, but took his penknife and fed himself the extract raw. He claims it saved his life, as for four days that was all he had with him to eat or drink. He says he felt fine and did his work better than when he had been where the food was palatable and he had eaten heartily. Of course he swears by the Extract and never takes a trip now without taking a good supply with him.--Mrs. H. L., Yorktown Heights, Westchester Co., N. Y.

Making Money for the Church 

"Besides selling recipes for eggless, butterless cake, we made seasoning bags to sell, for soups and such, using eight peppercorns, four cloves, six mustard seeds, one third teaspoon celery seed, four tiny sprigs each of thyme, summer savory, sweet basil, and parsley in each. This gives a blend pleasant to many tastes, and it is sufficient to flavor a soup for a large family. When the soup seems to have taken enough of the flavor the bag should be removed. To make one bag at a time would be foolish, but when enough are made to last the year out it helps out in fine shape. We also made jelly bags for sale, many ladies not having the right thickness of cloth in the house at jelly-making time." 
"At Christmas time the young girls of our congregation made quite a few dollars for the church by selling boxes of preserved orange. This is their recipe: Cut six large navel oranges in slices the long way of the fruit, and boil, until tender, in three waters, pouring off the water each time. Make a syrup of five cups of sugar and one cup of water and boil the orange in this until the syrup is almost boiled away. Remove with skimmer and let stand half an hour and roll each piece in granulated sugar. The confection was packed in dainty white boxes and covered with paraffin paper. They found a very ready sale."--K. C. B. 
"It has been our experience that everyday necessities in the household are better sellers than fancy nicknacks," writes a reader, "and when the social club of our church met last winter we decided to stick to them. Here are some of the things we made with the result that when we held our sale at Easter there was not one article left over and we had the sum of ninety-five dollars in the treasury." 

Ice Bags 
"These bags, made out of ordinary potato sacking, are for covering the cake of ice, and do much to keep down the ice bill. They are twenty-four inches long by twenty-seven inches wide and have a drawstring of common twine. They cost almost nothing and found ready sale at a quarter apiece." 

Wringing Bags 
"This idea we got from a trained nurse who was with us for a time, and it is a very good thing to have on hand when there is sickness. When hot cloths are to be applied it is hard to wring them out by hand as hot as the doctor would like. The bags are made of strong ticking and measure eighteen inches in width and are ten inches deep. At each end a loop the depth of the bag was stitched, through which a piece of broom handle was run when in use. To use, put the flannel into the bag, and set the bag into the pan of boiling water on the stove (first inserting the sticks). When ready, simply lift the bag and wring it by the sticks." 

Carpenter's Aprons 
"There has been a good deal of building done in our small town and one of our members, whose husband is a building contractor, offered to buy half a dozen carpenter's aprons if we would make them. This order has led to our making over two hundred of these aprons, as others hearing of it would want their aprons home-made rather than factory made. They are made of strong ticking, with a strap around the neck and another at the waist. In some, the straps are around the shoulders instead of the neck. Pockets are made for a rule, knife, nails, and a strap for a hammer."--Mrs. T. G. H.

Where Does Your Housekeeping Money Go? 
     Housekeeping money to many men means the actual money      required for food. Not very many husbands realize how many      little expenses the housekeeping money has to take care      of--little expenses that have nothing to do with food. Here      are some and the Editor will be very glad if the readers      will send in their own experiences in this line. 

[Illustration] 
Most men smoke, and most men like to pocket a nice fresh box of matches when starting off for the day. Matches don't cost much to be sure but a fresh box each morning cuts quite a hole in the housekeeping money which is used to buy them. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Does your husband like to sit up late reading, playing chess, etc.? That sort of thing increases the light and coal bill quite a bit. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
The pennies given for charity, church collections, etc., are also "extras." 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Returning little courtesies--very often to "his" people--such as sending flowers, books, and occasional lunch or matinee, etc., etc., all make quite a hole in the housekeeping money. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
The wear and tear of household utensils, linen, etc., means constant replenishment of one thing or another. A man may realize that his buggy or motor car has to have certain parts replaced once in a while but he is not apt to think of the pots and pans of the household side of things unless reminded. 
       *       *       *       *       * 
It is a good plan to keep a few simple medicines at hand in case of sudden sickness, also a few bandages and the usual dressings required for accidents. Does your housekeeping money make provision for this? 
       *       *       *       *       * 
Money for the education of the children is not generally included in the housekeeping money, but when the children get old enough to want to have their friends visit them it means little lunches, suppers, entertainments of various kinds, all of which cuts into the housekeeping money. As this is really the social side of their education it is only fair that extra provision should be made for it. 



Why Eat Fruit? 
[Illustration] 

It is a very good plan to find out the medicinal and curative properties of the different fruits and to make the fruit your system requires a part of your diet. 
Apples, for instance, have an excellent effect on the health generally. They contain a large proportion of water and a large quantity of potash as well as of malic acid, which has valuable properties, and ether which is beneficial to the liver. Plums, too, have certain virtues and lemons are good for several forms of stomach trouble. As for grapes, they are so valuable as to form a distinctive "cure" just in themselves. They possess an enormous quantity of potash and plenty of water and they also contain sugar and salts of tartar. That all means that grapes will do much for the person who is tired and run down, whose nerves are weakened and whose organs are overworked, that they will tone and regulate the system, purify the blood and assist the different organs in performing their functions. The presence of sugar indicates that they can provide fuel for the body--the human engine--whether it be the romping child or the man whose day is filled with hard physical labor. So it follows that grapes are really a very valuable addition to our diet list. 
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to have grapes on our table but wise manufacturers have found a way by which the juice of the grape may be possible at all times of the year and in every corner of the land. They have built large factories right in the very heart of the country where the best grapes grow and there the grapes are taken while the dew is still on them and their luscious fragrant deliciousness is squeezed out, poured into bottles and quickly sealed to prevent any escape of the exquisite bouquet. 
Nothing is added--no water to weaken and adulterate, no sugar to sweeten, no coloring essence to deceive the eye. It is just the pure, natural juice of earth's best offering. This bottled concentration of earth's sweetness and richness with all the life and warmth of the sunshine is Armour's Grape Juice.

Baked Beans--A National Dish 

To many people baked beans means just one thing--baked beans, served hot or cold. To the woman, however, who is really interested in furnishing variety in diet, and this in a very economical way, baked beans offers boundless possibilities. First of all, she lays in a stock of Veribest Baked Beans--Veribest, because she knows that in this particular brand the beans are even more thoroughly cooked than she herself could do them. There are two kinds of Veribest Baked Beans, plain, and with tomato sauce, and with both the mellow richness of the bean is preserved with all its natural flavor, making it a most toothsome dish as well as nutritious and economical. Having a good stock to draw from the economical housewife proceeds to serve baked beans to her family every day for a week, varying the dish each day. 
FOR MONDAY there is a New England Supper--baked beans with hot Boston brown bread. Drop the can of baked beans into hot water and boil for 20 minutes. Turn out, garnish with parsley and serve with mustard pickles. 
TUESDAY, FOR LUNCH.--BEAN CROQUETTES. Drain Veribest Pork and Beans (without tomato sauce), and pass them through a colander. Measure and allow one teaspoon of dry bread crumbs to each cup of beans. Season with cayenne pepper and a little minced parsley. For a pint of the mixture, beat one egg. Save enough of the egg to dip the croquettes in, and add the remainder to the beans. Mix and form into small croquettes, or balls, then roll in fine bread crumbs. Dip them in egg and again in the crumbs, and fry in deep boiling Simon Pure Leaf Lard. Border with slices of dill pickles or sweet green peppers. 
WEDNESDAY, SCHOOL LUNCHES.--BEAN SANDWICHES. Cut some thin slices from a loaf of brown bread, butter and put crisp lettuce leaves, with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, on each half of the slices, and on the others spread a layer of Armour's Veribest Pork and Beans, which have been mashed until smooth. Put the slices together and wrap each sandwich separately in paraffin paper. 
THURSDAY.--BEAN CELERY SALAD. Mix one can of Veribest Pork and Beans, four tablespoons of celery cut in one eighth inch rings, two tablespoons of finely chopped onions, and one fourth cup of good boiled dressing. Marinate thoroughly, but stir slightly. Rub the salad dish with a cut clove of garlic. Arrange lettuce leaves around the salad bowl and in the center make a mound of the salad mixture, to which one fourth cup of whipped cream has been added. Garnish with stuffed olives cut in rings. 
FRIDAY.--ATTRACTIVE LUNCHEON DISH. Heat one can of Veribest Pork and Beans (without tomato sauce), tossing about with fork to prevent breaking or mashing the beans. Season to taste. Serve in beet shells which have been previously prepared as follows: Wash the beets carefully, so as not to break the skins, and boil rapidly until tender. Then cover with cold water, and with the hands remove the skins. Scoop out the centers and fill the cases with the beans. Garnish with young celery leaves. 
SATURDAY.--PUREE OF BEANS. To one can of Armour's Veribest Beans and Tomato Sauce add two cups of milk; boil for a few minutes and pass through a sieve. Add salt and pepper to taste, a dash of sage, dry mustard and more water if required. Strain over croutons in the tureen and sprinkle with chopped parsley. 
SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPER.--BEAN LOAF. Two cups of Veribest Pork and Beans, mashed to a pulp, one fourth cup of chopped nuts, one cup of browned bread crumbs, two teaspoons of grated onion, two eggs, one half cup of cream or rich milk, one teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly and put into a greased bread pan. Brush with the beaten yolk of egg, milk or cream and bake one half hour. Serve with tomato sauce.

Homely Virtues 
    "Scorn not the homely virtues. We are prone     To search through all the world for something new;     And yet sometimes old-fashioned things are best--     Old-fashioned work, old-fashioned rectitude,     Old-fashioned honor and old-fashioned prayer,     Old-fashioned patience that can bide its time,     Old-fashioned firesides sacred from the world,     Old-fashioned satisfaction, with enough     Old-fashioned candour and simplicity,     Old-fashioned folks that practice what they preach." 



Answers to Correspondents 

_Please tell me the proper way to send wedding announcements. In a family where there are several young men and women do I send each a separate one?_ 
If economy is no object send each a separate card. If you do not care to do this and they are brothers and sisters you may say "The Misses Brown" and "The Messrs. James and John Wilson." 
_I would like very much to be able to help other housekeepers, but I always feel that I only know the simple things of my rather humdrum life in the country._--MRS. D., OHIO. 
What you know is not known to everyone, nor is what any housekeeper knows a matter of everyday use with other housekeepers. Everyone has some short cut or recipe, or personal way of doing things that would lighten the way for others. Your recommendation of butterine for instance, would carry weight with some housekeepers who had never before thought of trying it and they would be grateful always for being shown how to cut their butter bill. So with the other suggestions in your good letter from which I have taken extracts for the other pages. I want just such letters as yours. We must not forget that the younger generation of housekeepers are starting housekeeping and scanning columns like these for "the things everyone knows." 
_Yellow and white scheme for coming-out party._--H. M. B. 
Many thanks for the nice things you say about the Cook Book. Am very glad you have enjoyed it so long. The color scheme you mention could be carried out further by wearing white dresses with yellow sashes and hair ribbons. Have yellow ices and cakes with white and yellow frosting. Egg sandwiches, potato salad garnished with hard boiled eggs halved and yellow flowers, which are quite plentiful now would all help to carry out the idea. 
_What is the seventh anniversary of a wedding called? and is the celebration of these anniversaries out of style?_--E. G. T., BOISE CITY. 
It is perfectly proper to celebrate and you can have a merry time with little expense. Have tiny woolly toy sheep for favors and serve lamb salad (made after a chicken salad recipe). Wear a woolen dress and your husband white flannels. 
_I belong to a little card club and have to entertain the other members one afternoon soon. Can you suggest something which is easily prepared and can be served as a lap lunch?_--MRS. F. T., HUNTINGTON, W. VA. 
Ham mousse in individual moulds with thin bread and butter sandwiches. Ice cream served in cantaloupe. Iced tea with a slice of lemon and Armour's Grape Juice, which needs no flavoring. 
_What can I put with my silverware when packing it away to keep it from tarnishing?_--MRS. S. 
Pack in bags of Canton flannel before putting into the drawers or boxes and place with them a few pieces of camphor gum. 
_Please tell me if it is proper to eat cake with the fingers or must a fork be used?_ 
It depends on the cake. If one with a soft filling, a fork will be necessary. 

Requested Recipes 

FOR G. H. 
Molasses Custard 
Take one cup molasses (ribbon cane is the best; I have never tried corn syrup), add one half cup sugar, stir well and put on fire to boil for at least five minutes. Let cool for a short time, than add three well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly to keep the eggs from curdling. Add a tablespoonful of cornstarch. Bake in pie crust in the regular way but slowly. To keep from browning too quickly I sometimes place a tin in oven over pie. 
Many thanks to Mrs. F. A. F., Jacksonville, Texas. 

FOR MRS. T. H., OSWEGO, N. Y. 
Boiled Bacon 
Place the bacon in a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it. Bring the water to the simmering point and simmer gently until done (time, about half an hour for a pound for large pieces, less for smaller). Add to the water an onion with two or three cloves stuck in it, one carrot, one turnip and some sticks of celery. Skim carefully several times. When done, remove the skin and cover with browned bread crumbs. 

Found Out! 
When making shells for custard and lemon pies prick the crust all over with a fork before baking. Bake the shells over an inverted pie plate, then place them in pie plate as usual before filling.--Mrs. D. H., Media, Pa. 
If a cake gets scorched on top when baking, grate lightly with a nutmeg grater rather than try to scrape it with a knife. You will have a better surface for frosting.--C. K., Hurley, Texas. 
When your tablecloths begin to wear out make napkins out of the best parts and get a new tablecloth. 
Save your old newspapers and when you sweep soak the papers in water in which a tablespoonful of ammonia has been dissolved. Squeeze out and throw the paper pulp on the floor you are about to sweep. It will keep the dust from flying and at the same time brighten the carpets. 
Save all soap scraps and put them into an empty baking powder can that you have turned into a soap shaker by the help of a hammer and nail. Punch eight or ten small holes in the top and bottom, run a piece of wire from lid to bottom to hang it up by. When washing dishes shake the box in the water and you will have a nice suds. 
Do not throw away the small pieces of paraffin that you take from the tops of jelly glasses. They can be melted and used again. If you do not make jelly, use them to mix with the kindling. They start a fire like coal oil. Ends of candles may be used in the same way. If the wick in the lamp is short and you are out of coal oil, fill the lamp with water. The oil will rise to the top and the wick will burn as long as there is oil to burn. 
Put a tablespoonful of salt in your lamp and the blaze will be twice as bright.--C. L. E., Dayton. 
A damp or slightly oily cloth is all that is necessary to polish oak furniture if it is in good condition. Marks made by wet glasses should be rubbed with a mixture of nine parts olive oil and one part paraffin.--Mrs. W., Stilesboro, Ga. 
A very simple, attractive and inexpensive gift may be made by crocheting a simple edge for bath towels of the silk finished crochet cotton, and working the monogram or initial in cross stitch, using the same thread. The washrag should have a tiny edge to match.--Mrs. J. H. M., New Mexico. 
My linen dress had a tear and as it was bought ready made there were no left over pieces. I drew a few threads from the under hem and darned it with these and when laundered it could scarcely be seen.--Mrs. J. E. F. 



Hints for October 

A Hot Drink with the School Lunch 
Whether the individual drinking cup is a requirement in all public schools, or not, its use is a habit which should be encouraged. A collapsible cup takes up little room in the lunch basket. With it place one of the Armour Bouillon Cubes. At lunch time this cube dropped into a cup of hot water provides a drink of bouillon that is refreshing, stimulating and healthful. 
Armour's Bouillon Cubes, chicken and beef flavor, are sold in tins of 12, 50 and 100--each cube wrapped separately in tin foil. 

Fruit Out of Season 
The tonic value of pure fruit juices makes them desirable all the year around, and the caloric properties of grape juice place it at the head of the list. Just now the Armour factories, in the heart of the grape-growing sections of New York and Michigan, have their presses at work extracting the pure juice from the season's luscious Concords. This juice, undiluted, unfermented and unsweetened, is immediately bottled, retaining all the delicious fragrance and flavor of the grape. 
     For household use there are cases of bottles in quarter-pint      sizes and larger. Armour's Grape Juice is a splendid flavor      for desserts and ices. 

Government Inspection 
Housewives realize, more than ever before, their responsibility in selecting for their families foods that are wholesome and healthful. One of the strictest Government inspections is on butterine. In using Glendale Butterine there is a saving of fully one third over the cost of butter, and there is no question about its cleanliness, purity and wholesomeness. 
     Armour's Glendale Butterine is carefully wrapped and sold in      paraffined cartons. 

The Family Cupboard 
Anyone in the family can serve on short notice a meal that is sure to please,--_if_ the cupboard is well stocked from the extensive variety of Veribest Soups, Meats and Food Specialties. All are as thoroughly cooked and seasoned as in the home kitchen, and it's a simple matter to heat the contents of the cans and serve. 
     Best grocers in all parts of the country sell Veribest      goods. 

A Simple Lesson in Soup Making 
The usual process of simmering meats and vegetables is so tedious and troublesome that frequently soup is omitted from the bill of fare when there is good reason for its presence. It is especially beneficial in preparing the way for the easy digestion of heavier foods. Veribest Soups are scientifically cooked and seasoned. For use, heat the soup and dilute it to the preferred consistency. 

The Choice of the Many 
It is the greatest satisfaction to know of one breakfast dish that is always welcomed by guests. Whether they come from North or South, they relish sweet, crisp bacon. Armour's Star Bacon is a mild sugar cure, hickory smoked, and is most delicate. 
     Star Bacon is sold in glass jars and paper cartons. 

Keeping Household Accounts 
Buying ham by the single slice is necessarily much more expensive than buying a whole ham, for there is the cost of cutting besides the waste by this method. After slices are cut from the whole ham, considerable meat will be left on the bone. These bits can be used in many ways, and the bone can be boiled with vegetables or for soup. 
     Armour's Star Ham is cured and smoked by special process      which has given it the famous flavor. 

Little But Efficient 
No product is better known or more highly appreciated than the little jars of Armour's Extract of Beef. This Extract has many uses, and a little goes far in making soup stock, beef tea, flavoring the cheaper cuts of meat, gravies and vegetables. 
     Most druggists and grocers can supply Armour's Extract of      Beef in two sizes of jars. 

Women Who Succeed 
To have light, flakey pastry, doughnuts that are neither heavy nor grease-soaked, and fried dishes that are just right, our successful cooks have found that the first essential is good, old-fashioned pure leaf lard, tried out in open kettles, just as our grandmothers made it. Such is Armour's Simon Pure Leaf Lard, which is sold only in pails. Best dealers can supply it. 

A Luncheon Innovation 
A piquant meat filling for sandwiches--one that is already prepared and requires only careful slicing--is Armour's Summer Sausage. Each of the several kinds is a careful blending of meats and seasoning. Packed in casing, they will keep indefinitely and therefore it is possible to have a supply at hand ready for any emergency. 



The Secret of Good Cooking Is in the Flavoring 

Armour's Extract of Beef is the pure rich flavor of lean beef, in highly concentrated form. Its use solves many kitchen problems and makes for economy. Being four times stronger than ordinary extract, only one-fourth as much can be used, or your food will be too rich. 
     This Extract of Beef supplies delicious flavor to the      cheaper cuts of meat, enriches vegetable dishes, restores      original tastiness to left-overs, and flavors soups and      gravies. 
_Always keep a jar at hand. Sold by druggists and grocers._

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm 
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. 
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation 
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. 
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit http://pglaf.org 
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. 
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. 
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate 

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. 
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. 

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. 

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: 
     http://www.gutenberg.net 
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
